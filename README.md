# My-Summer-2024

## Summer Travel Experiences
During the summer, I travel back to my country, which is Vietnam. I got to see my sister, my nephew, and my niece. We went to malls and restaurants, and tried all my childhood food. I had a lot of fun with my family. It was the best summer I've ever had.

## Favorite Summer Food
My favorite summer food was **banh trang tron**. It's one of the most popular Vietnamese street foods. This is considered a snack for school students as every student in Vietnam eats this. 

Ingredients:
- rice paper
- quail eggs
- peanuts
- shrimp salt
- green onions
- young mango
- beef jerkey
- chili
- kumquat
- vietnamese coriander

## Most Memorable Experience
I went to Da Nang with my family. The beach was so beautiful. However, it was the storm season so there was a lot of rain during the trip. I got to ride the cable car and that was so cool and high. The ride was 10 minutes long. The view was kinda blurry because of the rain. There were many incidents that happened but that made the trip even more interesting. All we saw was fog because it's raining, so we decided to wake up at 5 am to go to the most popular golden bridge. The view of the city when sunrise from the golden bridge was INCREDIBLE. It looked like a painting. After taking tons of photos, we walked around the Sun World Ba Na Hills since it was early morning so nobody was around. We finished our breakfast then went to our last location of the trip, which is Hoi An ancient town. Everything is so beautiful there.

## Favorite Summer Memory With Friends 
My friend and I spent a day in a mall in Vietnam. We bought books, school supplies, and other cute stuff like keychains. My friend didn't know how to use Vietnamese dong so I helped her calculate the USD then tell her if it's cheap or not. The stuff we bought was really cheap when we exchanged it to USD. We brought five tanghulu and it was too much but really delicious. It was the first time we tried tanghulu.
