## Summer Travel Experiences
Durig the summer, I travel back to my country, which is Vietnam. I got to see my sister, my nephew, and my niece. We went to malls and resturants, tried all my childhood food. I had a lot fun time with my family. It was the best summer i've ever had.

## Favorite Summer Food
My favorite summer food was **banh trang tron**. It's one of the most popular Vietnamese street food. This considered as snack for school students as every students in Vietnam eat this. 

Ingredients:

## Favorite Summer Memory With Friends 
My friend and I spent a day in a mall in Vietnam. We bought books, school supplies, and other cute stuff like keychain. My friend didn't know how to use Vietnamese dong so i helped her calculate to USD then tell her if it's cheap or not. The stuff we bought were really cheap when we exchange to USD. We brought five tanghulu and it was too much but really delicious. It was the first time we try tanghulu.
